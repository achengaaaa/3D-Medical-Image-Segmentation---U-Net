# 3D-Medical-Image-Segmentation---U-Net

I implemented U-Net deep learning architecture aimed for medical image segmentation. Because of the dataset's 3D image nature, I constructed a data preprocessing pipeline before the traning of the Model. Finally, the model is able to correctly segment the spleen position from the 3D images.
